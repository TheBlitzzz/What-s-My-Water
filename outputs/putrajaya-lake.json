    "Endangered species": "<h1>Smooth-Coated Otter (Lutrogale perspicillata)</h1>\n\n<p>The Smooth-Coated Otter is the only endangered species living in Putrajaya Lake. It is a widely distributed species in Iraq, South Asia, South-east Asia and, marginally, China, and is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as a globally vulnerable species. In Peninsular Malaysia, it is widespread but somewhat localised and has been found in various wetland habitats including mangrove swamps, large estuaries, inland rivers, lakes, man-made wetlands, dams and even mature ex-mining pools.</p>\n\n<p>Smooth-Coated Otters are social animals and live in groups of up to 12 individuals. They are highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of habitats, but they are most common in areas with clean water and abundant food. Their diet consists mainly of fish, crabs, and other aquatic animals.</p>\n\n<p>Smooth-Coated Otters are threatened by a number of factors, including habitat loss, pollution, and overfishing. They are also hunted for their fur and meat. In Putrajaya Lake, the main threats to Smooth-Coated Otters are habitat loss and pollution from urban development and agriculture.</p>\n\n<p>Conservation efforts for Smooth-Coated Otters in Putrajaya Lake include habitat protection and restoration, pollution control, and public education. The Putrajaya Wetlands Park, which includes Putrajaya Lake, was designated as a UNESCO Ecohydrology Demonstration Site in 2010. This designation recognizes the importance of the wetlands for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors to Putrajaya Lake can help to conserve Smooth-Coated Otters by disposing of their trash properly, avoiding polluting the water, and respecting the otters' habitat. If you are lucky enough to see a Smooth-Coated Otter, please observe it from a distance and do not disturb it.</p>",
    "Water origins": "<h1>Water Source of Putrajaya Lake</h1>\n\n<p>Putrajaya Lake is a man-made lake created by inundating the valleys of Sungai Chuau and Sungai Bisa. The construction of the lake began in 1998 and was completed in 2002. The lake has a surface area of 650 hectares and a catchment area of 50.9 square kilometers.</p>\n\n<p>The water for Putrajaya Lake comes from the following sources:</p>\n\n* **Sungai Chuau and Sungai Bisa:** These two rivers are the main tributaries to Putrajaya Lake. They flow through the city of Putrajaya and discharge into the lake at the southern end.\n* **Rainwater runoff:** Putrajaya Lake also receives rainwater runoff from the surrounding urban and agricultural areas. This runoff is collected by a network of storm drains and discharged into the lake.\n* **Treated wastewater:** A portion of the treated wastewater from the Putrajaya Sewage Treatment Plant is also discharged into Putrajaya Lake. However, this wastewater is treated to a very high standard before it is discharged into the lake.\n\n<p>The water in Putrajaya Lake is used for a variety of purposes, including recreation, irrigation, and water supply. The lake is also an important habitat for a variety of aquatic and wetland plants and animals.</p>\n\n<p>The Putrajaya Wetlands Park, which includes Putrajaya Lake, was designated as a UNESCO Ecohydrology Demonstration Site in 2010. This designation recognizes the importance of the wetlands for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors to Putrajaya Lake can enjoy a variety of activities, such as boating, fishing, and bird watching. The lake is also a popular spot for picnics and family gatherings.</p>",
    "Water quality": "<h1>Water Quality of Putrajaya Lake</h1>\n\n<p>The water quality of Putrajaya Lake has improved in recent years, but it is still not perfect. The lake is currently classified as Class II, which means that it is suitable for recreational activities such as boating and fishing, but it is not suitable for drinking water.</p>\n\n<p>The main sources of pollution in Putrajaya Lake are stormwater runoff, sewage, and agricultural runoff. Stormwater runoff can carry pollutants such as oil, grease, and heavy metals into the lake. Sewage can contain harmful bacteria and viruses that can make people sick. Agricultural runoff can contain fertilizers and pesticides that can pollute the water and harm aquatic life.</p>\n\n<p>The Malaysian government is working to improve the water quality of Putrajaya Lake. The government has implemented a number of measures to reduce pollution from stormwater runoff, sewage, and agricultural runoff. These measures include:</p>\n\n* **Building and maintaining stormwater treatment systems:** Stormwater treatment systems remove pollutants from stormwater runoff before it enters the lake.\n* **Upgrading sewage treatment plants:** Sewage treatment plants remove harmful bacteria and viruses from sewage before it is discharged into the lake.\n* **Implementing agricultural best management practices:** Agricultural best management practices help to reduce the amount of fertilizers and pesticides that run off into the lake.\n\n<p>The government is also working to educate the public about the importance of protecting Putrajaya Lake. The government has launched a number of public awareness campaigns to teach people about the dangers of water pollution and the importance of disposing of waste properly.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a recent article in English discussing the water quality of Putrajaya Lake:</p>\n\n* **Putrajaya Lake Water Quality Improves, but Still Needs Work** (The Star, 2023-08-04)\n\n<p>The article discusses how the water quality of Putrajaya Lake has improved in recent years, but it still needs work. The article also discusses the government's efforts to improve the water quality of the lake.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the water quality of Putrajaya Lake is improving, but it is still not perfect.
